# Drew's Advent of Code 2017 Solutions

## What is this?

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017).

Because I primarily write Python for my day job, I am writing these in Python
for the sake of getting them done. I make no guarantees that these are the
fastest or best solutions, but they work.

## How do I run them?

Download and install pipenv and Python 3.7.

Edit the file to paste the inputs where you see `<paste inputs here>`,
then run `pipenv run python dayX.py`.
